# State of the Union

The rhetoric from both the democrats and republicans rings hollow at this point.  They've demonstrated that their ideologies do not bear fruit for the vast majority of Americans.  For instance, issues on both sides:

From the right, the idea of a free market is a great one.  But the very people who are carrying this slogan are the same ones who have completely corrupted the free market by implementing policies that subsidize and favor the companies that they're in bed with.

From the left, the idea of healthcare reform is a good one.  But the way that it's been implemented is a complete giveaway to the insurance industry.  I speak from personal experience.  The health care plan that is available to me today is 4x more expensive, with 2x the deductable of the plan that I was on before the "Affordable Care Act" was implemented.  That's an 8x reduction in effectiveness.

# Our Agenda

* Democratize the workplace through worker owned cooperatives, and other alternative ownership structures.  Healthcare coops are an option that should be looked at.
* Create tools and platforms that enable direct democracy and accountability of our representatives.
* Decentralize our infrastructure.  Power, water, food, construction, transportation, communication.  This will allow for greater resiliency, faster disaster response, and even the playing field making monopolies more difficult.
* Create a balanced economic model that re-integrates communities and gift economies and rewards sustainability, not growth, as its ultimate goal.

How can we raise awareness and participation for the creation of this future?
