# Climate Agenda

One thing to consider is that our government and society are complex systems, especially in the way that they interact with the ecosystem.  So it's very possible that even by addressing the "high priority" issues we might still be left with bottlenecks that prevent the overall dynamics that we are hoping to achieve.

I think the most important thing is that we hold a goal in mind, and we hold our representatives accountable to do whatever is necessary along multiple fronts to achieve that goal.  It may take some tweaks and adaptation along the way to get us there.

[This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.05878v1.pdf) explains the current situation and what we will actually need to do to reach the 1.5/2.0 C goals.  I quote:

```text
Such targets now require “negative emissions”, i.e., extraction of CO2 from the atmosphere.
```

In other words, cutting carbon emissions to zero is not sufficient to stop the train we have started.  We must not only cut emissions to zero, but begin an extraction process, on a scale as massive as the world economy itself.  Keep reading - it is actually possible for us to do this.

In the private sector, we can develop businesses which represent ecological and society impacts as stakeholders on their boards.  Worker owned coops have made strides in this area.  [TheNextSystem.org](TheNextSystem.org) documents advancements in this area.  I can't stress enough the importance of this - if we don't change the dynamics of our economic motivations, if we continue to consider the impact to humans and ecology as "externalities" then we will certainly continue the trend of consuming everything in our path without regard for sustainability.  There is hope for a more connected workplace which honors our humanity and our place in the universe.  There are examples of companies who have been successful in Spain, Italy, Ohio, some of them in the health industry.  Worker owned companies are a very American, very democratic idea, and can be presented as a non-partisan issue.

Here are some top technology/policy choices we can focus on:

1. Reduction/elimination of [fossil fuel subsidies](http://www.ibtimes.com/us-fossil-fuel-subsidies-increase-dramatically-despite-climate-change-pledge-2180918).  We need to provide alternatives in tandem, to reduce disruption to the economy.
1. Development of solar, and of battery storage systems ([Edison battery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel%E2%80%93iron_battery) looks promising.)
1. Electric vehicles.
1. Development of better insulation and passive heating/cooling.  For instance, a local company makes a product called [BetR-Blok](http://www.betr-blok.com/), also check out [smart glass](http://www.glass-apps.com/products/smart-glass-windows/).  A whole lot could be done in terms of architecture - including our own [Paolo Soleri](https://greenpassivesolar.com/2013/03/paolo-soleri-arcosanti-arcology/), and the [Earthship Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthship).
1. [Carbon negative cement](http://berc.berkeley.edu/carbon-negative-cement-turning-climate-liability-asset/) as a preferred building material.
1. [Biochar](http://www.biochar-international.org/biochar) as a soil nutrient renewal process.  Process has been used for thousands of years in the Amazon.
1. [Massive seaweed](http://phys.org/news/2015-05-seaweed-carbon-capturing-potential.html) and [algae farms](https://imedea.uib-csic.es/master/cambioglobal/Modulo_V_cod101611/Coastal%20sinks%20(seagrasses_mangroves_saltmarshes)/Bibliography_coastal/LargoDB_Seaweeds%20as%20Blue%20Carbon%20Sink.pdf) as a carbon sink, sucking carbon out of the oceans.  Helps reduce acidification, not just atmospheric C02.
1. [Splitting water](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1303.3308.pdf) and [methane collection](http://space.stackexchange.com/questions/3161/why-is-spacex-considering-methane-as-fuel-for-their-next-engine-the-raptor) for high torque and rockets.

In order to have effect on the scale of the national and global economy, we need our government to create policy around these issues.  Jill Stein has proposed a [green new deal](http://www.jill2016.com/plan).  Liberals will agree, conservatives will not.  So, I pose 2 questions to conservatives:

* If you don't want the government to move in, then how will you solve this problem through the free market?
* How will you do it in the necessary time, and considering that the government has been bought and paid for by those perpetuating the problem?

These are really tough issues.  We have a gun in our face, and they're not going to take it away just because we ask nicely.  The dynamics must change, and only the people collectively can demand that change.
